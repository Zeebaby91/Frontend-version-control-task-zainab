# Frontend-version-control-task-zainab

This repository demonstrates my understanding of Git and GitHub workflows — including branching, committing, pull requests, merging, reverting changes, and collaboration using version control.
### Branches and Their Purposes
- **main** – The main branch containing the stable version of the project.
- **feature-ui** – Contains the HTML and CSS code for the calculator interface.
- **feature-function** – Handles all JavaScript logic and arithmetic operations.
- **feature-header** – Adds a header section to the project page.


### Merged Pull Requests
